This mod replaces the female portraits with random male ones, if an update/mod adds in new female portraits or renames the portraits for some reason this mod will likely need to be updated. Additionally, this directs all links to the female sounds to male sounds for CIA and RANGER, so if any new sounds are added, this mod continue to link the old sounds only. That part is pretty simple to update. The XML defines sound packs, with different packs for male and female rangers and cia. Just copy the male ranger pack over the female ranger pack and similar for the cia.


Strangely the game has like 4 times as many female sounds as male sounds, particularly of the females being injured. The game has like 5 females, and like 13 sounds of female rangers being injured meanwhile their is like 100 men in the game and they get a single sound.


Please reup anywhere you want without credit.
